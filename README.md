This assignment is due Sun Jan 16 at midnight. 

The goal of this assignment is to test our github classroom infrastructure. This assignment is not required but is worth 10 bonus points.

# REQUIREMENTS:
- A working unix environment. TA's Recommend:

4. Run "./a.out", notice that it doesn't work. 
5. Use chmod to change the permissions of a.out to make it executable. 
6. Run a.out using "./a.out", to verify chmod worked.
